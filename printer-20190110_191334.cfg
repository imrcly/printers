heater: extruder,extruder2
#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with. If a comma separated list of heater names is
#   provided here, then the fan will be enabled when any of the given
#   heaters are enabled. The default is "extruder".
heater_temp: 50.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must drop below before
#   the fan is disabled. The default is 50 Celsius.
fan_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when its associated heater is enabled. The default
#   is 1.0

[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
min_point: 50,50
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
max_point: 250,250
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The z-axis position in which to start phasing z-adjustment out.
#   Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 10.0
#   The z-axis position in which phase out is complete. If this
#   value is less than or equal to fade_start then phasing out
#   is disabled. Default is 10.0.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
